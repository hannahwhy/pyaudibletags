#summary Classes

= Class `aafile` =

== Constructor ==

`class aafile(_filename_)`

_filename_ is either a string containing a fully-qualified filename including extension or an open file object

== Instance Methods ==

=== `headers()` ===

Returns a dictionary of 5 integers from the first 192 bytes of the file: 

 * `Filesize`: The size the file believes itself to be, in bytes, to detect truncated copies. 

 * `Magic`: The constant 1469084982 which identifies the file as being an Audible file. 

 * `TOC size`: Number of entries in the table of contents, as returned by `toc()`. 

 * `Number of content tags`: Number of entries in the tag table, as returned by `tags()`. 

 * `Magic2`: Magic repeated at the end of the table of contents.

=== `toc()` ===

Returns a dictionary of (usually) 12 integer tuples giving the location of various sections of the file as (offset, length). All of the tuples in the header are returned but the functions of only some are known: these are:

 * `Whole file`: offset (0) and length of entire file.
 
 * `Header terminator`: offset and length of the block that terminates the table of contents.

 * `Content tags`: offset and length of the tag table.

 * `Audio`: offset and length of the audio content (not including encryption data and decompression keys).

 * `Cover art`: offset and length of the cover art image data.

Entries in the table whose function is unknown have the key `Offset n` where n is the identifying number (0-11). These numbers are not necessarily in ascending order, although entries 0-2 always are.

=== rawtoc(formatted=0) ===

Returns the same data as `headers()` and `toc()` together but untranslated as (usually) 48 integers and laid out exactly as they appear in the first (usually) 192 bytes of the file. If `formatted` is set to 1 then the result is a multi-line string with the numbers laid out with spaces and line breaks to make them easier to understand.

=== tags() ===

Returns a dictionary of around 30 tags describing the audio content of the file (as opposed to file layout). The exact repertoire of tags varies and is richer with more recently published titles. This means that you cannot rely on a particular tag being present. 

The markup of text fields is not always the same.

 * The tags `author` and `narrator` may return comma-separated lists of names.
 * The description tags have single quotes that are sometimes \'escaped\', C-style, and sometimes not.
 * The `description` tags may contain html markup such as <I>...</I>
 * The `copyright` tag may contain html entities such as `&#169;` 

Books that come in multiple parts have Part 1, Part 2 etc in the individual titles; they may also have a `parent title` tag that gives the book title alone, but this is not always present. 

Books that come in multiple parts always have the tag `is_aggregation=collection` and will have a `parent_id` tag in addition to the `title_id` tag. 

The tags `HeaderSeed`, `HeaderKey`, `EncryptedBlocks` and `68ec733412b9` are always present and do not really fit the description of describing the audio content, since they appear to support the checksumming of the header and the encryption of the content, but they exist in the tag table along with and (to a program) indistinguishable from the others.
